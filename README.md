# Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Dedicated Server in Docker

**THIS PROJECT IS RETIRED AND NO LONGER SUPPORTED**

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter and is the fourth game in the
[Counter-Strike series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike). The game pits two teams against each other: the
Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate
objectives, the Terrorists, depending on the game mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, while the
Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or rescue the hostages. There are
eight game modes, all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode.

## Getting Started with Game Servers in Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is an open-source project that bundles applications into lightweight, portable,
self-sufficient containers. For a crash course on running Dockerized game servers check out [Using Docker for Game
Servers](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/blob/master/GameServers/DockerAndGameServers.md). For tips, tricks,
and recommended tools for working with Laclede's LAN Dockerized game server repos see the guide for [Working with our
Game Server Repos](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/blob/master/GameServers/WorkingWithOurRepos.md). You can
also browse all of our other Dockerized game servers: [Laclede's LAN Game Servers
Directory](https://github.com/LacledesLAN/README.1ST/tree/master/GameServers).
